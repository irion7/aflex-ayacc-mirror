AFLEX and AYACC
---------------
AYACC was updated with additional automatic error recovery features via the
Error_Recovery command line switch (see the documentation for details.)

IMPORTANT:  AYACC had the default values of Error_Code and Accept_Code
increased.  This is important is you are generating parsers for very large
grammars, and have had to increase Max_Rules beyond 1_000.  If you have had
to do this in the past you should regenerate your parsers.   The problem
shows up in incorrect behavior is the rules number 1000 or 1001 are
reduced in a running parser.

AFLEX was modified, with a -E switch added to generate additional information
needed by AYACC when the Error_Recovery switch is on.
