This is the IRUS (Irvine Research Unit in Software) aflex/ayacc public
distribution.  Aflex and ayacc are similar to the Unix tools lex and
yacc, but they are written in Ada and generate Ada output.  They were
developed by the Arcadia Project at the University of California,
Irvine.  Aflex is based on the tool 'flex' written by Vern Paxson.
These tools are copyrighted, but are freely redistributable.  There is
no warranty of any kind (see the copyright notice above.)  However we
do ask that you report any problems you encounter as we use these
tools ourselves and we want to fix any bugs that are found.

You may give this software to others, but we prefer that those who can
get it directly from us to insure that all users are running the
latest version.  We also ask that you send electronic mail to the
address irus-software-request@ics.uci.edu giving your name, your
organization, a paper mail address, and your e-mail address (either an
Internet address or a UUCP path relative to a well-known site such as
uunet.)  A form is provided below for your convenience.  We will use
this information to set up a mailing list to announce new versions of
aflex and ayacc, as well as new software that is expected to be made
available.

The distribution is currently available on the machine
liege.ics.uci.edu in ~ftp/pub/irus/aflex-ayacc_1.4a.tar.Z.  Full
instructions for retrieving and unpacking are enclosed below.  If you
have trouble retrieving or unpacking the distribution send mail to
irus-software-request@ics.uci.edu (or via UUCP to
uunet!sdcsvax!ucivax!irus-software-request) If you have trouble with
the tools information on how to report bugs is present within their
directories.

How to obtain aflex and ayacc via anonymous FTP

1.  FTP to the machine liege.ics.uci.edu (internet address 128.195.1.5)

2.  When asked for a username use 'anonymous'

3.  When asked for a password use your username on your local machine.

4.  Change directory (cd) into the pub/irus directory.

5.  Set a file transfer mode that will allow you to transfer binary
    files.  One way to do this that usually works is to issue the
    command 'type tenex'

6.  Type the command 'get aflex-ayacc_1.4a.tar.Z'

7.  Quit FTP.

8.  You now have a compressed tar file containing the source for aflex.

9.  You need to uncompress the file by typing 
    'uncompress aflex-ayacc_1.4a.tar.Z' 

10. Now untar the file to create the source and documentation tree by
    typing 'tar xvf aflex-ayacc_1.4a.tar' at the Unix prompt.

11. Read the README files in the aflex/README and ayacc/src/READ_ME to
    find out how to compile the tools.  If you are using the Verdix Ada
    Developemnt System Version 6 be sure to read the VADS6.README files
    in the aflex and ayacc directories before building them.
